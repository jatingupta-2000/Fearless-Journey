<h2> About the project </h2>
<p>This project is based on the real-world problem as a major (around 50-55%) percentage of road accidents is happen due to driver drowsiness. Taking this into consideration I think of a solution to develop an application using artificial intelligence that takes the real-time input and also does the real-time analysis. This software keeps an eye on the driver as a human and alerts them if they show any sign of sleepiness. I differentiate the alert into three main categories i.e. safe, need rest, and danger. This helps the driver as well as a passenger to have a safe drive.</p>

<h2> What problems solves ? </h2>
<p>With the help of this project, my main motive is the somehow decrease the percentage of road accidents. As the article published in the TOI also states that this issue is the main cause for the same. This application keeps an eye on the driver in the same fashion as human do and ring the alarm as found any sign of sleepiness of driver. To get a more accurate alert we differentiate the alert into a different categories. 
As the driver shows any sign of sleepiness it will automatically start the alarm and also state the mental condition of the driver i.e. the driver is properly fresh, or he needs rest, or probably sleep. As a result, we also know the driver's mood and also alert the driver while driving the car in case of any sign of sleepiness.</p>
